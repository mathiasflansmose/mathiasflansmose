# 👋 Hello! Welcome to My GitHub Profile

I'm a former teacher that is now studying **Computer Science** at Aarhus University. With a background in education and digital publishing, I bring a unique perspective to coding, balancing the curiosity of a student with the discipline and communication skills of a teacher.

### 👨‍🏫 About Me

- **Ex-teacher & Editor:** I spent 3 years teaching and another 4 working as an editor at a digital publisher.
- **Current Student of Computer Science:** Right now, I’m diving deep into CS fundamentals, especially data structures and algorithms. While I enjoy the theory, I’m passionate about writing code that’s clean, simple, and easy to understand.
- **Languages I Code In:**
  - **Python:** My favorite language! I believe the best code is readable and maintainable.
  - **Java:** I’ve been learning Java as part of my coursework and I really like working in a strongly typed language.
  - **C:** I’ve written search algorithms and worked on smaller projects in C as part of my learning journey.

### 💻 My Approach to Coding

- **Readable Code:** I strive to write code that speaks for itself. I believe that simple, well-structured code is often the best and is easier to debug, optimize, and share.
- **Problem-Solving:** I find joy in solving challenging coding problems, especially those that make me think critically. I may not be chasing every millisecond, but I understand the importance of efficient algorithms.
- **Learning Data Structures:** As I progress in my studies, I'm building my understanding of data structures and how they can help solve real-world problems effectively.

### 🔍 Interests

- **Python Projects:** I'm interested in building projects that solve practical problems and showcase the simplicity and readability Python offers.
- **Open-Source Contributions:** Although I’m new to open-source, I’d love to contribute to projects that prioritize clean code and educational value. If you're working on something along these lines, feel free to reach out!
